# Personalized-whatsApp-chat---Text-generation-with-LSTM
This mini-project builds a LSTM model to generate human-like Hindi chat messages.
The dataset is created from WhatsApp chat exports, cleaned by removing phone numbers, media lines, and noisy tokens.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
Load and clean raw WhatsApp chat data
Remove <Media omitted> lines and phone numbers
Prepare text for sequence modeling
Build an LSTM-based neural network



Train the model to generate realistic Hindi chat text

Generate new sentences using sampling
